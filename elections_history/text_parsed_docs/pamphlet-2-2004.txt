On the cover: When the current Oregon State Capitol was built in 1938, it was deemed fitting that two separate 
trails vital to the opening of the Oregon Territory be made monumental. A stele of Meriwether Lewis and William 
Clark, led by Sacagawea, flanks the east side of the Capitol steps (the pioneers of the Oregon Trail mark the west). 
The Leo Friedlander sculpture is carved from white Danby, Vermont marble. Photo courtesy of Oregon State

Dear Oregonian,  

You may notice some changes in the Voters' Pamphlet. These changes reduce the amount of blank space, 
allowing us to use less paper and save money on printing and production. All of the information that you 
need to use your Voters' Pamphlet and to cast an informed vote is still included; it is just in a different 
format.  

In commemoration of the bicentennial anniversary of the Corps of Discovery, the 2004 Voters' Pamphlets 
feature pictures, maps and documents relating to that historic expedition. Dispatched in 1804 by President 
Thomas Jefferson, U.S. Army Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led an expedition from St. Louis, 
up the Missouri River, over the Rockies and down the Columbia River to Fort Clatsop, near Astoria. There 
the Corps spent the winter of 1805-06 before making the return voyage. Their expedition brought new 

 

 

 

 
knowledge of geography, plant and animal life, and connected the Oregon territory to the rest of the nation. 
The success of the Corps was made possible by the assistance they received along the route from the many 
Indian Tribes they encountered.  

On the cover is a photo of a sculpture of Lewis, Clark and their guide Sacagawea that graces the front steps 
of the State Capitol, a reminder of their spirit of courage and cooperation.  

"Everyone must act according to the dictates of his own reason," said Thomas Jefferson, and it is on this 
principle that each person casts a vote. Your vote is your voice in the democratic process, and it 
demonstrates your own judgment and reason. Thank you for taking the time to make your voice count.  

If you are registering to vote for the first time or re-registering, please use the new voter registration card, 
available online at www.OregonVotes.org, or request a registration card by mailing in the form on page 3 
of this pamphlet.  

For those of you who are already registered to vote, please mail your ballot so it is received by February 3, 
or drop it off at one of your county drop sites. Remember, the decisions you make with your ballot will affect 
all of our lives and the future of our state.  

Best wishes,  

 

  
Bill Bradbury  
Oregon Secretary of State  

General Information 

Voters' Pamphlet  

Your official 2004 February Special Election Voters' Pamphlet provides you with information about 
Measure 30, a statewide measure referred to voters by referendum petition. Additionally, you can find 
information about vote-by-mail and voter registration, as well as contact information for county elections 
officials across the state.  

In this voters' pamphlet you will find the ballot title, estimate of financial impact, the complete text of the 
measure, an impartial statement explaining the measure and any arguments filed by proponents and 
opponents of the measure.  

The estimate of financial impact is prepared by a committee of state officials, including the Secretary of 
State, the State Treasurer, the Director of the Department of Administrative Services and the Director of 
the Department of Revenue. 
The committee estimates only the direct impact on state and local governments.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
The explanatory statement is written by a committee of five members, including two proponents of the 
measure, two opponents of the measure and a fifth member appointed by the first four committee 
members, or, if they fail to agree on a fifth member, appointed by the Secretary of State.  

Citizens or organizations may file arguments in favor of, or in opposition to, measures by purchasing space 
for $500 or by submitting a petition signed by 1,000 voters. Arguments in favor of a measure appear first, 
followed by arguments in opposition to the measure, and are printed in the order in which they are filed with 
the Secretary of State's Office.  

Measure arguments are printed as submitted by the author. The state does not correct punctuation, 
grammar, syntax errors or inaccurate information. The only changes made are attempts to correct 
spelling errors if the word as originally submitted is not in the dictionary.  

The Voters' Pamphlet has been compiled by the Secretary of State since 1903, when Oregon became one of 
the first states to provide for the printing and distribution of such a publication. One copy of the Voters' 
Pamphlet is mailed to every household in the state. Additional copies are available at the State Capitol, local 
post offices, courthouses and all county elections offices.  

Important!  

If your ballot is lost, destroyed, damaged or you make a mistake in marking your ballot, you may call your 
county elections office and request a replacement ballot. One will be mailed to you as long as you request it 
by January 29. After that, you may pick it up at the elections office. If you have already mailed your original 
ballot before you realize you made a mistake, you have cast your vote and will not be eligible for a 
replacement ballot.  

Your voted ballot must be returned to your county elections office by election day, Tuesday, February 3, 
2004.  

Postmarks do not count!  

County elections offices are open on election day from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.  

Vote-by-Mail 

What is Vote-by-Mail?  
Vote-by-mail is a method of conducting elections. Instead of using traditional polling places where voters go 
to cast ballots on election day, a ballot is automatically mailed to each registered voter. The ballot is then 
voted and returned to the county elections official to be counted.  

As a voter, what do I have to do?  
Your ballot packet will automatically be mailed to you between January 16 and January 20, 2004. Inside the 
packet you will find the ballot, a secrecy envelope and a return envelope. Once you vote the ballot, place it in 
the secrecy envelope and seal it in the pre-addressed return envelope. Be sure you sign the return envelope 
on the appropriate line. After that just return the ballot either by mail or at a designated drop site.  

What if I am uncomfortable voting my ballot at home?  
Privacy booths are available for you to cast your ballot. There are privacy booths at your county elections 
office and there may be others at drop site locations elsewhere in your county. For further information, call 
your county elections official.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
What if my ballot doesn't come?  
If you are registered to vote and have not received your ballot within a week after they are mailed, call your 
county elections office. They will check that your voter registration is current. If it is, they will mail you a 
replacement ballot.  

What if I have moved and have not updated my registration?  
If you were registered to vote by January 13 but now have a different address, call your county elections 
office for instructions on how to update your registration and receive a ballot.  

Do I have to return my ballot by mail?  
You have the choice of mailing your ballot or returning it to any county elections office or any designated 
drop site in the state. The times and locations of drop sites are available at your county elections office.  

How much postage is required to mail the ballot back?  
Your voted ballot can usually be returned using a single 37¢ stamp. In those instances where additional 
postage is necessary, it will be clearly indicated on the ballot materials.  

When must the voted ballot be returned?  
The voted ballot must be received in any county elections office or designated drop site by 8:00 p.m. on 
election night. Postmarks do not count!  

How do I know if my ballot is received?  
You can call your county elections office and ask if they received your ballot. A record is kept showing each 
voter whose ballot has been returned.  

Can anyone find out how I've voted once I mail my ballot?  
No. All ballots are separated from the return envelope before the ballots are inspected. This process ensures 
confidentiality.  

What if I forget to sign the return envelope?  
Generally, your elections office will either return it to you for signing or they will contact you, if possible, to 
come to the elections office to sign it. If the return envelope does not get signed before 8:00 p.m. on 
February 3, the ballot will not be counted.  

Can the public watch the election process?  
All steps of the process are open to observation by the public. Contact your county elections official to make 
arrangements.  

When will election results be known?  
Ballot counting cannot begin until election day. Initial results are released at 8:00 p.m. election night and will 
continue to be updated through election night until all ballots have been counted.  

Voters with Disabilities  

If you are unable to vote your ballot without assistance because of a physical disability or because you are 
unable to read or write, contact your county elections official. They will provide two persons to assist you in 
voting. In order to assure the county receives your voted ballot by election day, contact your county 
elections office early to arrange for assistance. You may also select someone else of your own choice to 
assist you.

CIGARETTE TAXES  

SECTION 1. Section 3, chapter 385, Oregon Laws 1995, as amended by section 1, chapter 589, Oregon Laws 
1997, section 10, chapter 1077, Oregon Laws 1999, and section 1, chapter 982, Oregon Laws 2001, is 
amended to read:  

Sec. 3. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 323.030 (2) and in addition to and not in lieu of any other tax, every 
distributor, as defined in ORS 323.015, shall pay a tax upon distributions of cigarettes at the rate of five mills 
for the distribution of each cigarette in this state occurring prior to January 1, [2004] 2006.  

(2) Any cigarette with respect to which a tax has once been imposed under ORS 323.005 to 323.482 and this 
section shall not be subject upon a subsequent distribution to the taxes imposed by ORS 323.005 to 
323.482 and this section.  

(3) The moneys received under this section shall be paid over and credited to the General Fund and shall be 
used exclusively to fund medical assistance under the Oregon Health Plan [as described under ORS 414.019].  

POLICY 

SECTION 2. (1) The intent of the Legislative Assembly in enacting a temporary graduated income tax 
assessment and the other new provisions and amendments to statutes in sections 3 to 43a of this 2003 
Act is to create a temporary source of revenues to maintain the levels of service that Oregonians expect 
in the areas of elementary and secondary school public education, senior services and public safety.  

(2) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that the revenues raised under the new provisions and 
amendments to statutes in sections 3 to 43a of this 2003 Act to be used:  

(a) For kindergarten through grade 12 public education are needed to avoid teacher layoffs, to maintain 
an adequate number of school days in the school year and to maintain or reduce class size.  

(b) For senior services and health care are needed to continue to provide prescription drug benefits on 
which elderly persons with fixed incomes rely, to continue Oregon Project Independence and to maintain 
urgent mental health care and Oregon Health Plan funding.  

(c) For public safety are needed to maintain existing public safety programs.  

(3) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that the fairest way to distribute the financial 
responsibility for these services is to apply the financial responsibility to as broad a base of Oregonians as 
possible and that the new provisions and amendments to statutes in sections 3 to 43a of this 2003 Act 
accomplish this objective.

(a) If, in computing federal income tax for a taxable year, the taxpayer deducted itemized deductions, as 
defined in section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer shall add the amount of itemized 
deductions deducted (the itemized deductions less an amount, if any, by which the itemized deductions are 
reduced under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code).  

(b) If, in computing federal income tax for a taxable year, the taxpayer deducted the standard deduction, as 
defined in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer shall add the amount of the standard

deductions or (ii) a standard deduction. Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, for purposes of 
this subparagraph, "standard deduction" means the sum of the basic standard deduction and the additional 
standard deduction.  

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the basic standard deduction is:

(iii) $1,640, in the case of a married individual who files a separate return; or  

(iv) $2,640, in the case of a head of household.  

(C)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, 
the Department of Revenue shall annually recompute the basic standard deduction for each category of 
return filer listed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. The basic standard deduction shall be computed 
by dividing the average U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the second quarter of the current 
calendar year by the average U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the second quarter of 2002, then 
multiplying that quotient by the amount listed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for each category 
of return filer.  

(ii) If any change in the maximum household income determined under this subparagraph is not a multiple of 
$5, the increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $5.  

(iii) As used in this subparagraph, "U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index" means the U.S. City Average 
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 
the United States Department of Labor.  

(D) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the additional standard deduction is the sum of each 
additional amount to which the taxpayer is entitled under subsection (7) of this section.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
(E) As used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, "surviving spouse" and "head of household" have the 
meaning given those terms in section 2 of the Internal Revenue Code.  

(F) In the case of the following, the standard deduction referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph 
shall be zero:  

(i) A husband or wife filing a separate return where the other spouse has claimed itemized deductions under 
subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;  

(ii) A nonresident alien individual;  

(iii) An individual making a return for a period of less than 12 months on account of a change in his or her 
annual accounting period;  

(iv) An estate or trust;  

(v) A common trust fund; or  

(vi) A partnership.  

(d) For the purposes of paragraph (c)(A) of this subsection, the taxpayer's itemized deductions are the sum 
of:  

(A) The taxpayer's itemized deductions as defined in section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (reduced, if 
applicable, as described under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code) minus the deduction for Oregon 
income tax (reduced, if applicable, by the proportion that the reduction in federal itemized deductions 
resulting from section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code bears to the amount of federal itemized deductions 
as defined for purposes of section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code); and  

(B)(i) The amount that may be taken into account under section 213(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, not to 
exceed seven and one-half percent of the federal adjusted gross income of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer has 
attained the following age before the close of the taxable year, or, in the case of a joint return, if either 
taxpayer has attained the following age before the close of the taxable year:

(1).  

SECTION 42. ORS 311.676 is amended to read:  

311.676. (1) Upon determining the amount of deferred taxes on tax-deferred property for the tax year, the

elected to defer homestead property taxes in a prior tax year has not filed a timely claim for deferral for one 
or more tax years succeeding the year in which property taxes were initially deferred under ORS 311.666 to 
311.701, then the individual may request that the Director of the Department of Revenue grant a 
retroactive deferral of property taxes on the property. A spouse who is eligible to make the election under 
ORS 311.688 may also request a grant of retroactive deferral under this section.  

(2) The director may, in the discretion of the director, grant or deny the retroactive deferral of property 
taxes. No appeal from a decision of the director under this section may be made.  

(3) The director shall not grant a retroactive deferral of property taxes if, in any intervening year between 
the year in which deferral was last granted to the property and the last year for which retroactive deferral is 
being requested, the property would not have been eligible for deferral had the claim for deferral been 
timely filed.  

 
 

 

 

 
(4) If the director grants a retroactive deferral of property taxes under this section, the department shall pay 
to the county tax collector an amount equal to the deferred taxes for each year, less [three percent] the

of July 1 of that tax year.  

SECTION 43. ORS 311.780 is amended to read:  

311.780. (1) Upon receipt of the notification from the Department of Revenue of the amount deferred on

county tax collectors an amount equivalent to the full amount of tax listed by the department less [three 
percent thereof] the amount of discount allowed under ORS 311.505.  

(2) The department shall maintain accounts for each deferred property and shall accrue interest on the 
gross amount of taxes advanced.  

(3) The funds provided for the payment made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be made as 
investments from the excess funds mentioned in ORS 293.701 (2) (o).  

SECTION 43a. ORS 311.392 is amended to read:  

311.392. (1) If, in the discretion of the county court, it is more economical to advance to those municipalities 
from the general fund of the county the total amount of taxes, assessments or other charges levied against 
property in the county, the county court may advance from the general fund of the county the full amount of 
the taxes, assessments and charges levied by those subdivisions and the county court may order the county 
tax collector to revise the tax distribution schedule provided by ORS 311.390 so that all taxes, assessments 
and charges advanced by the county will be allocated to the county. If the county makes the payments 
provided in this section, it shall have no recourse against the political subdivision for recovery of the 
shrinkage in collections from that anticipated at the time the payment was made.  

(2) If the county advances taxes under this subsection, before December 1 of each year, it may deduct from 
the levy the [three percent] discount [which] that would have been given by the district had all of the taxes 
been paid by November 15 and turned over to the district on or before December 1 of each year. If the 
payment is made after December 1, no discount shall be taken by the county.

For the stability of Oregon's 

Schools and Economy...  

Oregon PTA asks for your 
YES vote on Measure 30  

For nearly 100 years, Oregon PTA has advocated 

on behalf of children and communities for a 
quality education for every child in Oregon. 

We have members in every corner of the state -  

from small rural towns to the largest cities. 

We support Measure 30 because it brings stability and certainty to Oregon's parents, children, schools and 
economy. Overturning this bipartisan balanced budget would take hundreds of millions of dollars directly 
from our children's classrooms.  

YES on Measure 30 restores a full school year in Oregon schools.  
YES on Measure 30 ensures that our children have the basic tools they need to learn - like new textbooks 
and smaller class sizes.  

 
 

 

 
YES on Measure 30 maintains the cigarette tax, a deterrent against teen smoking.  
YES on Measure 30 is a vote for our Oregon, our livability, and our future.  

 

 

There is no Plan B for today's children. By supporting Measure 30, Oregonians will take control of our 
state's destiny and our children's future. Measure 30 protects the basics in our schools and will help our 
economy recover by investing in our future - not mortgaging it away!  

Every Oregon child deserves the certainty of a full school year.  
Every Oregon child deserves the security of classes small enough to get the personal attention they need.  
Every Oregon child deserves the stability of educational programs that challenge and engage.  
Every Oregon child deserves to learn the basics for the 21st century - including computer, vocational and 
technical skills.  
Every Oregon child deserves a chance to succeed. 

Please Join Oregon PTA in voting 

YES on Measure 30!

Argument in Favor  

AARP, with 456,000 Oregon members over the age of 50, supports a "YES" vote on Measure 30. This bi-
partisan balanced budget plan is fiscally conservative, stable course for uncertain times. Measure 30 
preserves certainty and security for AARP members and all Oregonians who care about our children, 
grandchildren, seniors, and adults with disabilities.  

While some of our members may pay a little more with this balanced budget, we are certain the increased 
value from financial stability and security far outweighs the costs. The alternative could be devastating. 
Only the passage of Measure 30 will ensure the stability and certainty for many of our most vulnerable 
Oregonians.  

By voting "YES" we maintain successful long-term care services. Home-based care like Oregon Project 
Independence, offers dignity for seniors in need. When elderly and disabled patients can stay in their own 
familiar homes, families and taxpayers save money.  

A "YES" vote provides stability for volunteer services, like the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, that 
we rely upon to strengthen our communities.  

A "YES" vote maintains prescription drug coverage for those low-income seniors and people with 
disabilities who have high prescription drug costs. In many instances this is the only opportunity to 
receive the life-saving medications.  

A "YES" vote continues Oregon Health Plan coverage for 85,000 lower income Oregonians. The loss of this 
coverage forces many people to already crowded emergency rooms - the most expensive and least effective 
way to treat basic care needs. This in turn continues to make quality health care less affordable for everyone 
else.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
As parents and grandparents, we support a "YES" vote that allows our children and grandchildren to better 
maintain a quality education without larger classroom sizes and/or less school days. Our economy needs a 
well trained work force.  

AARP urges your support for the bi-partisan balanced budget plan that provides economic security and 
certainty for Oregonians of all ages.  

Please join us in voting "YES" on Measure 30.

Urge a YES vote on Measure 30 for Oregon's Health!  

Vote "Yes" on Measure 30 to Help 
Maintain Oregon's Cigarette Tax  

Measure 30 renews a 10-cent cigarette surtax that has been in effect since 1993. If the measure fails, the 
tax will end and Oregon would be the first state in a decade to lower its cigarette tax.  

Vote "YES" on Measure 30 to Help 

Prevent Youth from Smoking  

Keeping cigarette prices higher has been shown to be one of the best ways to keep youth from smoking. If 
Measure 30 fails, Oregon's cigarette tax will be lowered, making it cheaper for youth to get cigarettes.  

Vote "YES" on Measure 30 to Help 
Stabilize the Oregon Health Plan  

The revenue from the 10-cent cigarette surtax is used to fund the Oregon Health Plan for low-income 
Oregonians. If Measure 30 fails, ending the surtax, it is estimated that it would put an additional $22 million 
hole in the Oregon Health Plan for the next two years.  

Vote "YES" on Measure 30 to Help 

Solidify the Tobacco Prevention and Education Program  

The Oregon Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) began in 1996 by a vote of the people. It 
has already been reduced by 70% due to budget cuts, even though estimates show that for each dollar 
spent on the program, the state saves $33. Every pack of cigarettes sold in Oregon costs taxpayers $7.58 in 
state subsidized services. If Measure 30 fails, it will create an $800 million deficit, and further budget cuts. 
This could entirely close down Oregon's tobacco prevention program, in spite of the money it saves 
taxpayers.

What's at stake? Children and Families have a lot at stake...  

--Children's psychiatric day treatment could face a cut of $2.4 million.  

--The Oregon Children's Plan could lose an additional $2 million. That means children lose alcohol and drug 
treatment, mental health services to families, and community based mental health services for children.  

--Oregonians could lose their mental health and chemical dependency benefits from the Oregon Health Plan 
and the mental health prescription drug coverage for the medically needy.  

--The Oregon Health Plan could be cut by more than 80,000 people--seriously unraveling the healthcare 
safety net.  

What's the answer? Passage of Measure 30--the bi-partisan, balanced budget agreement...  

•  Oregonians need a secure and stable budget to ensure Oregon's future and to keep Oregon, "Our 

Oregon" a place to be proud of! 

•  Oregonians can't afford to mortgage the future of our children and families on the failed borrow 

and spend tactics of Measure 30 opponents. 

•  Oregon businesses, schools and local communities need certainty and steadiness through a 

balanced budget in order to create jobs and grow our economy. 

Who Pays for Measure 30? How Will it Work?  

= Profitable corporations who currently pay only $10 per year in income taxes will finally be required to pay 
at least $500 and unnecessary corporate tax loopholes will be eliminated.  

= Smokers will continue to pay their fair share of tobacco-related healthcare costs by maintaining the 
decade old 10-cent 
cigarette tax.  

= Those who make less, pay less - the plan is progressive, so as income goes down, so does the amount paid.

Argument in Favor  

Our state was built by the hard work and cooperation of many people, in both private and public sectors. 
We've become a national model for balancing business productivity and providing appropriate services so 
people can be successful community members.  

Education, public safety and social services create opportunity throughout our economy. But health costs 
have made insurance impossible for thousands of working families, and for people who pay ever higher 
premiums, most are not covered for mental health or disability. Few people are prepared when shift 
happens to them...  

Oregon's safety net once assisted eligible people facing the challenges of chance, returning thousands to 
their communities and workplaces. Today, Oregon's economy is struggling as it did in the mid-eighties, but 
because of tax changes, we've just experienced the biggest public funding crisis since the Depression.  

Though Oregon's budget has increased in the last decade, so have tax cuts, inflation, population, 
unemployment and prisons. Dismantling services has cost far more in emergency care, and leaves people 
without resources to manage dire circumstances.  

Citizens for a Sound Economy is a Washington DC lobby working to use Oregon as an example for their 
national agenda. They say this tax proposal Is bad for business, but many Oregon businesses support 
adequate funding for public services. Documented studies proved businesses base location choices on 
quality of life, not the tax burden.  

Opponents say there's no proof of dreadful consequences, but research shows that due to last year's budget 
cuts, thousands lost their jobs, their homes, and dozens lost their lives.  

Voting yes will bring more security and employment to thousands, and the less we earn, the less we'll pay in 
taxes.  

If economic and ethical concerns are equally valued, then providing for the common good creates more 
success for everyone. Fair taxation honors the interdependent rights and responsibilities we all share as 
Oregonians.

Argument in Favor  

Democratic Party of Multnomah County urges a YES vote.  

The Multnomah County Democratic Platform reads in part:  

 
 

 

 

 

 
"We support excellent public education, including higher education, that is adequately funded and makes 
clean, healthy, safe and secure schools available to all. These goals cannot be met without renewed vigorous 
leadership at the state and federal levels and a commitment to long range strategic planning to assure 
Oregon's future."  

All 25 Democratic Representatives and 11 Republican Representatives worked together to develop a 
solution that meets these goals. These Representatives showed bi-partisan leadership by solving the State's 
budget problems without caving in to the pressures of politics as usual.  

Prior to this legislative action, the voters in Multnomah County authorized a County Income Tax for the 
purpose of filling a portion of the gaps in funding for education and local services. Multnomah County

Oregon Business Association Urges a YES Vote on Measure 30  

Oregon Business Association - "...private-sector leaders...seeking to forge bipartisan consensus in the 
Legislature on issues that will affect Oregon's economic well being for years to come." --The Oregonian, June 
5, 2000  

Vote Yes for Stability and Certainty for Oregon's Economy  

We believe that the adequate funding of state and local services is essential to attracting and retaining good 
jobs and private investment in our state. Oregon's schools and other public services need certainty and 
stability now, as well as in the future, and voting yes on Measure 30 will help provide stability.  

A yes vote on Measure 30 is a bridge to Oregon's economic future. By protecting the quality of life that 
citizens and businesses desire - high-quality schools, supportive health and human services, effective public 
safety and steadfast environmental protection - we can help ensure the future health of our economy.  

The Oregon Business Association supports the revenue package passed by the Legislature to protect 
Oregon, and we ask Oregonians to vote yes on Measure 30.  

In so doing, we emphasize our association's commitment to businesses paying their fair share to maintain 
Oregon's essential public services.  

We also support this measure because it means that those that earn less will pay less.  

Integral to our position is Multnomah County's agreement to reduce the temporary income tax surcharge 
passed in May if Measure 30 passes.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
The Oregon Business Association is stepping up for Oregon's future by supporting Measure 30. We 
encourage other businesses, organizations and citizens who care about achieving a vital economy across 
our great state to do the same.

Keep the Services We Need 

For a Stronger Economy  

With so many Oregonians out of work, we need to do everything we can to protect public services and 
rebuild our economy.  

Easier said than done.  

With fewer people working and more businesses hurting, state revenues declined more than 25% in the last 
budget period. Faced with a shortfall of that magnitude, it just wasn't possible to keep all public services 
intact.  

But legislators came up with a plan that tapped reserves, borrowed against future revenues and cancelled 
pay raises for public workers. They shut down programs, like youth detention facilities. And, as a last resort, 
they enacted temporary tax increases that will be paid primarily by those with good incomes and by 
businesses that benefit from public services.  

All this was done to maintain the minimum funding we need for strong schools, healthy families, safe 
communities and a stronger economy. It was the right thing to do, and it's working.  

Recent reports indicate we're starting to get back on our feet. Economists forecast job gains in the months 
ahead. The last thing we need now is to repeal the budget-balancing plan that will get us through the next 
eighteen months.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
We will do serious harm to our future if we again fail to keep our schools open for a full school year, keep our 
courts in session five days a week, keep families on the Oregon Health Plan and keep prisoners in prison and 
police on the street.  

That's what we learned less than one year ago, when our failure to maintain these basic services made us the 
poster child for a failed state. We cannot afford to go through that experience again.  

Keep the funding we need for strong schools, healthy families and safe communities.  

Keep the services we need to attract businesses, sustain good jobs and rebuild our economy.  

Vote YES on Measure 30.

A VOTE FOR MEASURE 30 

IS A VOTE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY  

Over the past several years, the state legislature has made wholesale cuts to Oregon's public safety budget. 
Now, it's up to us to restore the most critical services to keep our communities safe. We can do that with 
Measure 30.  

Measure 30 is a reasonable, fair approach to protecting our most important services. Without this 
bipartisan balanced budget, our safety is at risk.  

•  Oregon State Police could be forced to eliminate forensics positions all across the state, resulting in 

possible dismissal of criminal cases due to lack of evidence. That reduces public safety.  

•  Youth corrections services would be cut, sending juvenile offenders back to their communities. That 

reduces public safety.  

•  The reductions are so deep that we may even have to release up to 350 inmates per month - before 

they have served their time. That reduces public safety.  

•  These cuts will leave law enforcement, correctional officers and district attorneys at a 

disadvantage. That reduces 
public safety.  

We can stop these cuts with Measure 30 and we can do it without borrowing schemes that mortgage 
away our future.  

As a sheriff on the front lines of keeping our communities safe, I can tell you that this is no political scare 
tactic - this is reality. A chunk of your tax money is used to keep the troopers on the road and prisoners in 
prison. When there isn't enough money, the troopers and prisoners go home.  

Please join me in voting YES on Measure 30 - for all of our safety.

Vote YES on Measure 30 to protect higher education  

Your YES vote on Ballot Measure 30 is crucial for Oregon's public universities and for Oregon's future.  

Public education in Oregon faces a financial crisis at every level, from K-12 through higher education. Our 
public schools, community colleges, and universities are in a precarious position because of the recent 
budget cuts and the ever-growing demand for our services. Because of continued financial pressures, the 
State has not been able to maintain its investment in higher education. If Measure 30 fails, our public 
universities face even more devastating cuts.  

The balanced budget plan passed by the legislature invests in the education of our citizens. Oregon's 
universities are an 
indispensable strategic asset for our citizens, our businesses, and our state. The skills, creativity, and 
research developed through higher education are the determining factors in Oregon's success in creating 
jobs and prosperity. Now is not the time to make additional cuts to higher education. Now is the time to 
reinvest in Oregon's public universities and stimulate a new era of social and economic growth for the state.  

The defeat of Measure 30 will be costly to our future and we urge you to consider very carefully your vote 
on Measure 30 and what it means to the economy and to students from every corner of our state.  

Please consider the thoughtful and deliberative process that led to approval of the compromise bipartisan 
balanced budget and Vote Yes on Measure 30.

Children and Public Education Need Your Support: 

Prevent Immediate Cuts to Schools  

The Teachers and School Employees of Oregon 

Urge You to Vote YES on Measure 30  

Oregon's economic recovery depends on a vibrant, stable education system and good schools. In the past 
two years, however, Oregon has cut $500 million from our excellent system of public education. This has 
resulted in lost school days, staff reductions, program cuts, and so much more. Without a YES vote on 
Measure 30, another $414 million may be lost.  

• 

If the Legislature's bipartisan balanced budget plan is not approved, many school districts will be 
forced to shorten their school year...again.  
Students will lose essential programs...again.  

• 
•  Districts will lay off teachers and other school personnel, increase class sizes and put off building 

repairs...again.  

•  The school children of Oregon will get shortchanged...again.  

Only with an educated and highly skilled work force can Oregon hope to compete with other states for high-
wage jobs. Businesses need access to qualified, educated employees and they need good schools for their 
employees' families. When schools deteriorate, communities deteriorate.  

As veteran classroom teachers, we have seen the devastating impacts past cuts have had on our students. 
We work hard every day to ensure that your education tax dollars are invested wisely in building their 
futures. Please join us today in supporting the bipartisan plan to protect our students, our future and our 
Oregon.

Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon Urges "Yes" on Measure 30  

The ranks of the poor, unemployed, and uninsured have grown in Oregon. Religious social service agencies 
have been overwhelmed by many who have asked for help from soup kitchens, shelters, substance 
treatment centers to elder care facilities. Religious social service agencies and churches are unable to fulfill 
all the need.  

Social services are most needed and demanded during times of economic and social distress. Charities 
cannot do it alone. Measure 30 ensures that government plays its part in helping to fund important services 
like the Oregon Health Plan, elderly care, mental health, public education and public safety.  

Society has a moral responsibility to care for the poor and most vulnerable, to safeguard its communities 
and to educate its children. This principle is solidly grounded in both the Old and New Testament and 
especially in the teachings of Christ himself.  

Measure 30 is the result of a bi-partisan agreement that took 8 months to negotiate after all available 
options were exhausted. Measure 30 restores most crucial services cut from the state budget.  

Repealing the balanced budget plan would result in serious reductions in social services including programs 
that help the elderly and disabled live in dignity. As many as 85,000 poor Oregonians could lose coverage 
under the Oregon Health Plan. Children would lose school days.  

The temporary tax surcharge is applied based on ability to pay, protecting those least able to afford 
increased taxes. The less one makes, the less one pays. If the economy improves, the tax will be 
automatically rescinded in the final year.  

Measure 30 ensures that society's needs are met and funded responsibly without jeopardizing our 
children's future through borrowing.  

Help religious social services help Oregonians by allowing the state to do its part.  

Please vote YES on Measure 30, and let us pull together for Oregon!

Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems 

Urges your 'Yes' vote on Measure 30  

When you need it, you want access to the highest quality health care in your own community. The right care, 
provided at the right time in the right way. That's why Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems 
and its 62 member facilities support Measure 30.  

 
 

 

 
Measure 30 will help keep everyone's health care costs down  

 

 

Without Measure 30, hospitals will see an increase in the number of people who seek medical care in 
already overcrowded emergency rooms. A hospital ER is the most expensive form of health care, and with 
more uninsured patients to care for, hospital costs will go up for patients with insurance and for businesses 
who try to do the right thing by providing health insurance.  

Measure 30 will protect the Oregon Health Plan  

In these tough economic times, the need for the Oregon Health Plan is greater than ever. Without this 
critical health care program, Oregonians who are laid off and lose their health insurance may be left 
stranded. If we don't pass Measure 30, thousands more Oregonians could lose their health care coverage 
because the state will be forced to cut $150 million in health services and will automatically lose another 
$225 million in federal matching grants.  

Measure 30 protects local jobs and local economies  

In many Oregon communities, hospitals are the largest employer. If Measure 30 fails, many hospitals may be 
forced to eliminate important community services, and jobs could be at risk. Oregon can't afford the loss of 
any more family wage jobs. By investing in the health of our economy and our citizens we can save money in 
the long run and hasten our economic recovery.  

Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems has always been a strong supporter of the Oregon 
Health Plan.

Urge your YES VOTE on Measure 30  

The Health Care Safety Net represents medical clinics that treat insured and uninsured Oregonians. Our 
group includes doctors, school-based health centers and community clinics throughout Oregon.  

Oregon's health care system needs the certainty and stability Measure 30 provides. Up to 85,000 Oregon 
Health Plan patients could lose insurance coverage if Measure 30 fails.  

•  A "Yes" vote will help keep health care costs lower 

Uninsured Oregonians needing treatment often seek care in costly emergency rooms, and are 
unable to pay the full cost. Who pays the rest? Insured Oregonians do. According to the American 
Medical Association, insured individuals pay for uninsured patients through higher insurance 
premiums and other health-related costs (AMA, Struggling to Ensure Your Employees Receive Quality 
Affordable Health Care? 5/03). Avoid this "hidden tax" by voting YES on 30.  

•  A "Yes" vote keeps quality doctors in Oregon 

According to the Oregon Medical Association, access to health care is at crisis levels on a statewide 

 
 

 

 

scale (Jim Kronenberg, OMA Online Press Release, 5/23/03). Quality doctors are leaving Oregon 
because they often do not receive adequate payment under the Oregon Health Plan, Medicaid and 
Medicare. Oregon now struggles to recruit new doctors because they are not reimbursed for all for 
their costs. Help keep quality doctors in Oregon by voting YES on 30.  

 

 

•  A "Yes" vote protects an already strained health care system 

Increases in the number of uninsured Oregonians place heavy demands on safety net clinics and 
emergency rooms. If Measure 30 fails and an additional 85,000 people lose Oregon Health Plan 
coverage, many small, rural clinics and hospitals will be strained to the breaking point. Protect 
quality health care across Oregon by voting YES on 30.

provide excellent health care for our children, seniors and families.

On February 3 OREGON WILL MOVE  

FORWARD - OR - BACKWARD  

Our communities are just beginning to recover and economic progress depends on stability in our schools. 
The balanced budget provided by Measure 30 will allow our schools and the communities they support the 
stability they need to continue in their recovery.  

Our schools and community colleges lost 1,600 jobs last year due to budget cuts. That's 1,600 fewer 
educators to provide our kids with the world-class education they need and deserve and 1,600 fewer jobs 
that support our local economies. Measure 30 will help begin the process of recovering from those losses.  

Oregon's economic recovery depends on a stable education system and good schools. Without the balanced 
budget funded by Measure 30, our schools could lose more than $400 million in additional cuts in this and 
the next school year. Our schools and our economic recovery depend on Measure 30.  

Opponents would like you to believe we should lower our educational standards, rather than fund our 
schools. Lowering the quality of our kids' education is a backward idea that will shortchange their dreams 
and harm our ability to have a world-class workforce. That just doesn't make sense.  

Everyone knows that if our kids don't get a high quality education, and our workforce isn't highly trained, 
our economy can't compete in the global markets. Our economy will move backward rather than forward. 
Our kids will fall behind rather than move ahead. We simply can't afford to move backward.  

The 18,000 educators of the Oregon School Employees Association urge you to join us in our determined 
effort to reject backward thinking and to move our Oregon forward to a more positive future for our kids 
and our communities.  

If we say YES on Measure 30, Oregon will move forward - to a brighter future.

Children are the future of Oregon. Our economy and our quality of life depend on the next generation. 
Nothing is more essential to a child's future than a good education.  

Good schools with stable funding are a major factor in businesses staying or locating in Oregon. Oregonians 
should be proud of our schools, and proud that we have always supported schools, by volunteering, donating 
our time, and voting for education funding.  

Despite the great job our schools are doing, state budget woes have resulted in 1000 teacher layoffs, 
schools closing early, and larger classroom sizes across the state.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
If Measure 30 fails, schools could lose over $400 million dollars, including: Medford schools $9 million, 
Springfield schools $12 million, North Clackamas schools $11.25 million, Beaverton $23 million, Salem-
Keizer $14 million, and the list goes on.  

Districts across the state will have overcrowded classes and fewer school days.  

Don't let this happen!  

Measure 30 is a reasonable, affordable, smart approach to balance Oregon's budget. The average Oregon 
family will only pay about $3 a month. For this modest amount, hundreds of schoolchildren will receive the 
basic level of education they need, 85,000 people will stay on the Oregon health plan, and we will maintain 
other key services for thousands of poor children.

Your Neighbors in Clackamas County Urge a YES vote on Measure 30  

Measure 30 provides certain and stable funding for Clackamas County while protecting seniors, schools, 
public safety and other vital services. Measure 30 ensures that we have a full school year for every child in 
Clackamas County and prevents increases in class size. It maintains programs like Oregon Project 
Independence that help Clackamas seniors stay in their own homes, and protects the prescription drug 
benefits of thousands of needy seniors and persons with disabilities.  

WHAT'S AT STAKE?  

Schools  

Clackamas County school districts are threatened with severe cuts if Measure 30 fails. For example, West 
Linn-Wilsonville could lose as many as 75 teachers, and North Clackamas could lose 8 weeks of school if 
they deal with the reduced revenue by cutting school days.  

Human Services  

Thousands of Clackamas County seniors and persons with disabilities depend on the Oregon Health Plan to 
help cover medical expenses. Without the balanced budget provided by Measure 30, our neighbors could be 
among the estimated 85,000 Oregonians who will lose OHP coverage.  

Safety  

Our Clackamas County Sheriff's office is among the busiest and best in Oregon, handling hundreds of calls 
per day. But if Measure 30 fails, Clackamas Community Corrections could lose nearly a million dollars in 
state support. Likewise, our prosecutor's office is handling some of the state's most difficult criminal cases, 
and could be hit with serious reductions in workforce if Measure 30 fails.

Argument in Favor  

"The strongest organization of parents who fight for schools - the Coalition for School Funding Now." 
The Oregonian, May 17, 2002  

An Urgent Message from 

The Coalition for School Funding Now  

PLEASE VOTE YES ON BALLOT MEASURE 30  

The Coalition for School Funding Now is an independent, non-partisan voice for Oregon's K-12 public 
schools. We are a grassroots statewide organization made up of parents, business leaders, community 
leaders, education advocates, students, teachers, school board members and concerned citizens who 
believe that each K-12 student in Oregon should have access to a high quality public education.  

Since 1996 we have worked for long-term, adequate and stable funding that would provide certainty for all 
K-12 schools in Oregon. We support efforts being made to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and 
accountability of our schools, but we also need to make sure that every child has a full school year and 
reasonable class size in every school in Oregon. Measure 30 is a compromise that will help to guarantee that 
certainty and stability.  

•  Oregon's schools need certainty and stability now, as well as in the future and voting yes on 

Measure 30 will help with stability.  
Strong public schools are necessary for a strong economy. Oregon businesses depend on a high 
quality education system to provide educated and skilled workers for jobs.  

• 

• 

•  Public education creates opportunity for all of Oregonians. Preparing Oregon's children for the 

workplace of tomorrow is vitally important to our future.  

•  Vote YES on Measure 30. It is a responsible, fair and balanced revenue package passed by bi-

partisan super-majorities in both chambers.  
Stability for our schools means prosperity for Oregon.

MEASURE 30:  

Vote YES--It's the right thing to do 

to protect seniors AND the community!  

Elders in Action supports 

the bi-partisan balanced budget plan.  

 
 

 

 
Measure 30: A first step to helping provide assurance and stability for all Oregonians.  

 

 

Measure 30: Fair to seniors, schools, families, and businesses. Let's keep all the wonderful things that make 
Oregon a safe and prosperous place to live and work.  

Measure 30: The only solution to the state's budget crisis that does not depend on a "borrow and spend" 
scheme, which would mortgage Oregon's future.  

Measure 30: A balanced approach to keep our schools open, keep our communities safe and maintain 
services for our elderly, poor and disabled.  

Your "YES" Vote on Measure 30 will:  

•  Help provide relief for costly prescription drugs. Many low-income seniors are simply unable to 

afford the drugs they need to live, and they should not have to do without.  

•  Help fund Oregon Project Independence. This cost-effective program helps over 4,000 frail seniors 

to remain independent and in their own homes.  

•  Help keep 85,000 people on the Oregon Health Plan, which provides healthcare services for those 

who cannot afford it. Many senior and disabled people receive these critical services.  

•  Help crack down on identity theft and fraud crimes, which disproportionately impact the elderly.  
•  Help keep our schools funded and operating so that every Oregon child can receive a quality 

education.  

MEASURE 30: IMPORTANT TO SENIORS  

MEASURE 30: IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY  

THE ELDERS IN ACTION COMMISSION 
URGES A "YES" VOTE ON MEASURE 30  

(This information furnished by Mr. Fran Landfair, Chair, Elders in Action Commission.)  

Argument in Favor  

Vote Yes to Protect Vital Public Services  

Public services are crucial to the health of our communities. Families rely on public services to take care of 
our seniors, educate our children, provide health services, and for public safety. Everyone benefits from 
reliable, quality public services.  

SEIU members - frontline workers - see firsthand how necessary public services are. We deliver quality 
public services that Oregonians rely on whether its helping seniors get around in Wasco County, going out 
in the middle of the night to clear a road in Eastern Oregon, or helping a new university student get through 
the maze of financial aid. We work with seniors and people with disabilities so they can live in their own 
homes with dignity. The public services we provide touch every family throughout Oregon.  

Support Measure 30 to maintain the public services our communities need.  

Ballot Measure 30 is a fair revenue measure because those who earn the least pay the least and 
corporations like Enron/PGE pay their fair share of taxes on profits instead of paying only $10 a year.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
We urge support for Ballot Measure 30 to protect services for the most vulnerable in our society. The list of 
what could be lost is a long one that includes:  

•  85,000 working poor losing health coverage on the Oregon Health Plan  
•  1,200 seniors losing access to home care or nursing homes, and many more losing prescription drug 

relief  

•  Elimination of community corrections programs  
•  Cuts of up to 28 school days for our children in some districts  

A Yes vote is a vote for public safety, for our children's education, support for our seniors, and a vote for 
the quality of life we want for everyone in our communities.

Children with Disabilities and Their Families 

Need Your YES Vote on Measure 30  

The Oregon Family Action Coalition Team urges you to provide certainty and stability in the lives of our 
most vulnerable children and their families. Protect social and human services and our schools with your 
YES vote.  

Help us begin to get off the roller coaster of funding cuts and service reductions with this balanced, fair plan 
that asks a little of each of us to help our children a lot.  

Children with disabilities cannot wait while the adults in our state continue to battle over budgets. They 
need:  

Stable services and supports that keep them with their families in their own homes.  

• 
•  The chance to learn in good schools, without reduced calendars.  
•  Opportunities to participate in their communities with appropriate supports.  
•  Access to quality medical care and therapeutic interventions.  

These needs are basic to their daily lives - things that many people take for granted - and help children with 
disabilities grow up to lead independent, productive lives.  

The alternatives are far more costly, in both the human toll and the long-term financial expense.  

Please vote yes on Measure 30, 

and invest in our children, our families, our future.

Our Southern Oregon communities are strong and prosperous because our schools, social services, and

Measure 30 is PROGRESSIVE and FAIR: those who earn less, pay less. The cost to the average Southern

Health Care Costs are Skyrocketing.  

Oregon Nurses, Health Care Providers, Consumers and Business Owners 

Urge you to Vote YES on Ballot Measure 30  

Ballot Measure 30 ensures health care coverage for 85,000 working Oregonians, prescription drug 
coverage for 6,000 low-income seniors and access to mental health services for Oregon children and 
families.  

If this measure fails, more uninsured Oregonians will seek care in emergency rooms, driving up costs for 
everyone and thousands of Oregon families will go without preventative check-ups and lifesaving 
medicines.  

The health care impacts are serious - for patients and for Oregon's economy. Every dollar cut from the 
Oregon Health Plan cuts an additional $1.50 in federal funding. The health care industry is one of Oregon's 
largest employers. Cutting these state and federal resources will translate into the loss of family wage jobs 
in local communities across Oregon.  

"As a nurse, I urge you to vote YES on Ballot Measure 30. Cutting health care coverage for 85,000 
Oregonians will leave our clinics and emergency rooms over-crowded and increase health care costs for 
Oregon businesses and working families."  

-Karen Ferge, RN, Salem  

"I have been struggling for years with medical problems including Diabetes and a heart condition. I am now 
unable to work and depend on the Oregon Health Plan for survival. If Ballot Measure 30 fails, I will lose my 
health care coverage. I'm not sure what I'll do."  

-Vern Smith, St. Johns  

 
 

 

 

 

 
"As a business owner, it's difficult to provide health insurance to my employees and their families. Our 
health care costs are rising at unsustainable rates. If Ballot Measure 30 fails, health care costs will increase 
even more."  

-Tori Hudson, Sherwood  

Please join nurses, health care providers, consumers and business owners in voting YES on Ballot 
Measure 30 - to maintain health care coverage for working families and protect Oregon's fragile 
economy.

RURAL OREGONIANS say "YES on 30"  

Small town and rural Oregonians need the stability that Measure 30 provides for our schools, seniors, and 
businesses.  

Endless cuts to needed services not only hurt our most vulnerable citizens; these cuts also hurt our local 
economies due to the loss of public sector family wage jobs.  

We need a fair, progressive tax structure, where those who earn less pay less. Measure 30 is a good step in 
that direction.

Argument in Favor  

The Oregon Nurses Association urges 

a "YES" vote on Measure 30 

Don't Cut Health Care for Oregonians  

Last year Oregon experienced the deepest cuts to its public health system in memory.  

If Ballot Measure 30 fails it gets even worse.  

Basic Health Care: Last year almost 50,000 low income, working Oregonians lost health care benefits for 
themselves and their families.  

Nurses on the front lines of health care have seen the results of these cuts:  

•  Untreated contagious illnesses like the flu are spreading unchecked  
•  Oregonians are not seeking preventive care for conditions like diabetes  
•  Chronic conditions like cancer and heart disease are going undetected  

These patients will end up in the emergency room at much higher costs. And these hospital costs are passed 
on to paying health care consumers.  

The 2003 Legislature rewrote the Oregon Health Plan emphasizing managed care, reducing the treatments 
available to low income Oregonians. Fewer people have access to health care today. However, high 
unemployment and a poor economy have increased the number of low income Oregonians.  

Ballot Measure 30 will stabilize the Oregon Health Plan and ensure families, seniors, and children get the 
health care they need.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Mental Health: Last year state and county health services were cut deeply. For most of 2003 unstable, 
suicidal, and often violent people have been released or turned away from public health care.  

Nurses on the front lines have seen the results of these cuts:  

•  Mentally ill people on the streets get hurt and end up in the emergency rooms  
•  Many mentally ill people end up in prisons receiving treatment from prison nurses  
• 

Some mentally ill people end up hurting others  

It is more expensive to have mentally ill people in prison or treated at an ER. Ballot Measure 30 would 
restore some services to the mentally ill and help them get the treatment they need.

Oregon Catholic Conference Supports Measure 30  

Measure 30: A Bipartisan, Balanced Budget for the Common Good  

Poor, weak and vulnerable Oregonians have a special call on our compassion. Oregon's revenue debate is 
not merely about the numbers of financing state government. This debate is about the morality of state 
public policy. Caring for the most vulnerable persons in our midst, particularly poor women, children, elderly 
and disabled persons, and funding education are moral issues of the common good. As part of Oregon's 
bipartisan, balanced budget, Measure 30 provides resources for social services for vulnerable persons and 
education for children.  

Churches and Charities Provide Social Services But Cannot Replace Government  

Oregon's churches and charities are partners with government in meeting peoples' needs. Through our 
schools, hospitals, nursing homes, dining halls, food pantries and clothes closets, churches and charities 
address the unmet needs of our fellow Oregonians. During this difficult time in the economy, we see 
firsthand and have compassion for the growing number of people in need. Churches and charities, however, 
cannot replace the services provided through government. It is not the mission of churches or charities to 
replace government, nor do we seek to do so. We can and do supplement what government does to aid and 
care for our fellow Oregonians regardless of a person's faith.  

Measure 30 Supports Stability in the Social Services Safety Net  

 
 

 

 

 

 
During the past three years, the Oregon Catholic Conference, together with the interfaith community, has 
advocated maintaining the safety net of social services for people in need. After the longest legislative 
session in Oregon's history, let us support state fiscal stability contained in the bipartisan, balanced budget. 
Let us remember the common good for Oregon and our responsibility for our fellow Oregonians.

Argument in Favor  

VOTE YES ON MEASURE 30  

The stakes have never been this high. If Measure 30 is turned down by the voters at the February 3, 2004 
special election, state and local services that Oregonians expect and need will be devastated. We cannot 
allow this to happen.  

Measure 30 was a carefully devised, bi-partisan response by the Legislature to the severe state general fund 
shortfall for the 2003-2005 biennium. The plan's core features are temporary tax surcharges that will allow 
essential services to be maintained at adequate levels. Over the past several years, the Legislature has 
exhausted all the one-time, stop-gap funding options that were available and this revenue package was the 
only reasonable alternative left.  

If Measure 30 were to be defeated, a budget reduction plan that the 2003 Legislature adopted will go into 
effect. This plan includes huge cuts in education, human services and public safety programs. These 
reductions may not yet seem real, but if they occur Oregonians will be stunned by the resulting harmful 
effects.  

In the public safety sector, critical services will be eliminated or severely curtailed. Oregon's Circuit Courts 
may again be forced to reduce regular hours of operation. Many criminal cases will not be able to be 
prosecuted because funds will not be available to provide counsel to indigent defendants. State and 
Community Corrections programs will be crippled. State Police services will be cut back from their already 
reduced level.  

At this election, Oregonians are being asked to make a choice between a state that is willing to make short-
term financial sacrifices to preserve basic services and protect our most vulnerable citizens, and a state that, 
in bad economic times, is willing to abandon these citizens and the core government programs that they 
need and deserve.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
We think Oregonians will make the right choice and vote in favor of Measure 30. Join your friends and 
neighbors in supporting this measure.

Argument in Favor  

This Voters' Pamphlet statement is going to be different. No bulleted one-liners from an expensive poll. No 
"hitting on the talking points." Just some straight-from-the-heart common sense.  

Opponents of Measure 30 are hyping this as a tax increase, plain and simple. People like Mr. Mannix, Mr. 
Walker and Mr. Sizemore have painted Measure 30 proponents into the corner of looking as though we 
ONLY want more money. While that may be a great campaign tactic, it's simply not true. We support 
Measure 30 because we care about Oregon.  

Schools are shutting down, often and early. Essential public services -- not "extras" -- are being eliminated. 
Seniors are being hurt. This isn't the Oregon we know and love.  

Here's an example our organization knows all too well. In the past decade, we've shut down the state's two 
major mental institutions, Fairview and Dammasch. Yes, some clients are in private or state operated group 
homes. But many others are on the streets and/or committing crimes. Prisons are clogged with MR/DD 
prisoners; 1 in 5 state prisoners suffer some form of mental illness. Corrections officers aren't trained to 
deal with them, and they become victims themselves inside prison walls. Now lawsuits are pending against 
the state over some of these cases, just one example of what happens when we chop vital public services.  

So what is Measure 30? It's a band-aid, nothing more. It's not a cure-all. But it is a necessary component of 
getting Oregon back on track.  

The Legislature will meet in 2004 to review Oregon's tax structure. We support that; something needs to be 
done. But lawmakers don't need another $800 million in cuts hanging over their heads. Let's pass Measure 
30, keep Oregon a state we can be proud to live in and all work together for a better system in the future.  

Because, in the end, that's what we all want -- a better Oregon.

BENTON COUNTY YES ON 30  

Benton Yes on 30, a coalition of citizens, educators, businesspeople senior and disabled persons and health 
care providers, urge your YES vote on Measure 30, the Bipartisan Balanced Budget. Here's why:  

Stability  

The Bipartisan Balanced Budget maintains essential services and infrastructure, such as schools and senior 
services. It is superior to borrow and spend tactics that destabilize Oregon's finances and public services. 
Instability erodes our credit worthiness, which raises interest expenses on state bonds.  

Prosperity  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Full employment is vital to support our locally owned businesses. Measure 30 provides the security and 
stability that is essential for business planning and for attracting new enterprises to Oregon and to Benton 
County.  

Education  

In a knowledge-based economy, education is increasingly important. Measure 30 supports our public 
schools, colleges and universities. It keeps them viable, available and affordable to prepare our children for 
family wage jobs.  

Security  

Food, shelter, medical care and personal safety are fundamental to our quality of life. Measure 30 assures 
that:  

•  85,000 needy Oregonians continue to get life sustaining care and medications through the Oregon 

Health Plan  

•  Elderly and disabled who live independently in their own homes with the assistance of Oregon 

Project Independence can continue to do so  

•  300 - 350 convicted criminals per month who might otherwise be released early remain in prison.  

Fairness  

A recession is hard on everybody. Measure 30 places the burden on those who can most easily bear it:  

•  The income tax surcharge is based on ability to pay. It amounts to little or nothing for taxpayers 

with modest incomes.  

•  Corporate minimum taxes are based on sales  
•  Unnecessary tax breaks are eliminated

The bipartisan budget plan:  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Creates certainty and stability. It protects schools, seniors, public safety and the courts. These vital services 
support Oregon families as they work to turn our economy around.  

Supports seniors and their families. It helps seniors and the disabled stay independent and healthy. It 
provides prescription drugs for needy seniors.  

Supports education. Oregon's economic recovery depends on a stable education system and good schools. 
Strong schools mean a strong economy.  

Is fair and progressive. It makes the tax system fair; those who earn less will pay less, with the poorest 
Oregonians paying nothing. The average Oregonian will pay only $24-$36 more per year in state income 
taxes.

poorest and most vulnerable residents will be met. This work is accomplished in partnership with the State 
of Oregon - a partnership we can uphold by supporting Measure 30. In these times of economic reversals, 
organizations like ours are stretched to the limit. More Oregonians are in poverty. The time has come for all 
of us to provide much needed help. Measure 30 is a temporary remedy that will bridge the gap while our 
economy and our state heal.  

Support Measure 30  
A majority of us will be paying just pennies a day to sustain our most essential services. We can make a 
crucial investment in our communities. To do otherwise will be more costly in both human and fiscal terms. 
Measure 30 makes a short-term community investment with long-term benefits.

Last year we witnessed the kind of havoc that funding uncertainty can reek on our schools when we saw 
schools close early losing weeks of valuable classroom time. Our schools and our students should not be 
made to endure the kind of damage that was caused by such actions. By voting YES on Ballot Measure 30, 
we can provide certainty and ensure that our schools stay open all year providing continuity and stability in 
our educational programs statewide.  

OUR ECONOMY IS RELYING ON IT!  

The failure of Ballot Measure 30, and subsequent reduction in state revenues, will only result in fewer jobs 
for Oregonians, fewer educational opportunities for students, and a loss of essential services for Oregon's 
most vulnerable citizens and will tear down the quality of life in Oregon that we all cherish. Oregon's schools 
are the foundation of a local community's economic infrastructure; by throwing those very schools into 
turmoil, we are going a long way toward destroying the viable economic base of nearly every local 
community in the state.  

OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER!  

The opponents of Measure 30 would save money by stripping our education system of the standards that 
have made Oregon's students some of the highest achievers in the world. Do we really want that? Do we 

 
 

 

 

 

 
really want to provide a third-rate education for our children? The bipartisan balanced budget plan, of which 
Measure 30 is the hinge, ensures for the immediate future that we don't leave our students behind.  

Can we ensure funding for our schools? 

Can we begin to pull our economy forward? 

Can we provide a world-class education to our students? 

YES WE CAN!  

On behalf of the 20,000 members of the Oregon School Employees Association, I am 

asking you to vote YES ON BALLOT MEASURE 30.

Ballot Measure 30  

A Yes Vote for Oregon's Future  

The Association of Oregon Faculties and its members on the campuses of the Oregon University System 
urge Oregonians to support Ballot Measure 30.  

Our state's future depends on how well we educate our young people. In the 21st century, how our public 
higher education system meets the needs of its students will be critical to ensuring that our future leaders 
are prepared and stay at home in Oregon.  

If Ballot Measure 30 is rejected, damaging budget cuts will result that could cripple Oregon's education 
system. For our public universities, the only response will be to reduce quality or, once again, raise tuition.  

We cannot allow quality to suffer. Cuts to faculty and staff positions will mean fewer academic programs 
and the overcrowding that exists will only get worse. Oregon's public universities have to stay competitive 
with their counterparts in other states or we will experience a "brain drain" of students and faculty.  

Our students cannot afford any more tuition hikes. It is already too expensive for many Oregon students to 
attend their state universities.  

Measure 30 is a carefully crafted, balanced and bipartisan solution to the severe funding problems that the 
2003 Legislature faced. The $2 billion shortfall that existed for the 2003 - 2005 biennium was real and 
needed a real solution. Measure 30 fits that requirement. It imposes a temporary increase on income 
taxpayers, both individuals and businesses, and uses the revenue to fund essential services.  

It's time for Oregonians to put our best foot forward. If we truly want this state to prosper and provide the 
quality of life we say we desire, then we need to support essential government services. Voting for Measure 
30 is your chance to do just that.

Treating Alcohol and Drug Abuse 

is a Smart Investment 

Yes on 30!  

In communities from Klamath Falls to Roseburg to Baker City, Oregon's Community alcohol and drug abuse 
treatment programs are working to help Oregonians rebuild lives and families devastated by addiction.  

•  A 'Yes' vote on Measure 30 will help bring down health care costs  

Untreated alcohol and drug addiction drives up the cost of medical services and health care for all of us. 
Addiction treatment is one of the most cost-effective and efficient tools we have for bringing down heath 
care costs. Measure 30 is fiscally responsible and makes sure that Oregonians receive needed care.  

 
 

 

 

•  A 'Yes' vote on Measure 30 will help Oregonians become productive citizens  

 

 

With proper treatment, many addicts can dramatically change their lives and become contributing members 
of our society. Many former addicts have rebuilt their lives and become valued members of their 
communities. Together we can get people back to work and contributing to our economy.  

•  A 'Yes' vote on Measure 30 protects health care for thousands of Oregonians  

Without the passage of Measure 30, up to 85,000 Oregonians could lose their health coverage. Oregon's bi-
partisan balanced budget protects the health care that is essential to the well being of thousands of low-
income Oregonians and their families.  

•  A 'Yes' vote on Measure 30 helps reduce child abuse and crime rates  

When addicts receive the treatment and help they need to become productive citizens, it means fewer 
people committing crimes and fewer families devastated by addiction. Child abuse and neglect rates go 
down and children in foster care can go home to safe and self-sufficient families.  

As small businesses, as your neighbors, as people committed to helping people who are working to help 
themselves - The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program Association of Oregon urges your support of Measure 
30 and this respon-sible, balanced budget plan.

MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES URGE A 

YES VOTE ON MEASURE 30  

Mental health advocates and the Mental Health Matters Campaign urge your 'Yes' Vote on Measure 30. 
This bi-partisan, balanced budget plan will ensure funding for basic mental health and addiction services and 
provide treatment and necessary medications to thousands of mentally ill Oregonians.  

Measure 30 Protects Critical Mental Health Services  

If Measure 30 is defeated thousands of Oregonians will lose services through cuts in areas including:  

•  Medically needy coverage for mental health prescriptions  
•  OHP mental health and alcohol and drug treatment  
•  General Assistance for persons with serious mental illness  
•  Day treatment for children and adolescents  
• 
Supported employment to assist in recovery.  

Without these critical services, many with serious mental conditions are abandoned and left on their own, 
often ending up in the emergency room, the hospital or in jail.  

Measure 30 Ensures People with Mental Illness  

Get Treatment  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Just as those suffering from mental illness need stability and certainty in their lives, our state budget and

Oregonians with disabilities urge a Yes vote on Measure 30.  

They are some of Oregon's most vulnerable citizens. Their cost-effective services allow them to lead 
productive lives in our communities.  

Oregon closed its state institutions; no longer do we segregate people because of their disabilities. If 
community services are now cut, where will people with disabilities go?  

These services allow people to lead lives that are safe and ful-filling and to be contributing members of their 
communities. These services are far less costly than state institutions, but they need public support.  

Please don't gamble with their lives. Don't wreck this balanced budget. The smoke and mirror tricks of 
outsiders will not replace a budget that was the best compromise our legislators could agree upon.  

We are people with disabilities, families, advocates, and community care providers, and we urge you to 
vote YES on this essential Measure.

YES FOR SCHOOLS  
"Bend LaPine schools have already trimmed 10% from the budget in the past four years. If this balanced 
budget plan fails, we will be forced to cut another 11%. That equals 27 school days, or 180 employees or

Please vote yes to protect our schools and our community."  

Gary Bruner, retired teacher, Bend

"50,000 Oregonians, including many seniors, could lose access to the Oregon Health Plan, increasing health

"If the balanced budget is repealed, our local community corrections office will lose almost $6 million, 
forcing the potential lay-off of probation staff. Forensic services will cut staff, delaying evidence tests and

LANE COUNTY "YES" ON MEASURE 30  

Here's what people in Lane County are saying about why you should vote "YES" on Measure 30.  

"YES" FOR THE ECONOMY  
"To attract and retain good businesses, we must adequately fund schools and other public services. Measure 
30 is a hard-won, imperfect, necessary compromise; if it fails we'll be right back in crisis and sending 
precisely the wrong message about doing business in Oregon."  

-Jenny Ulum, small business owner and past Chamber of Commerce leader  

"YES" FOR SCHOOLS  
"Each of us lives in a local school district. We care about the success of our local school children. With 
Measure 30's short-term revenue, your local school district can avoid further harmful setbacks to the 
precious education of your community's children."  

-Garry E. Weber - Board Chairman Springfield Public Schools  

"YES" FOR SENIORS  
"The health, safety and independence of senior and disabled Oregonians are at stake. Without this 
temporary tax, cost effective programs providing prescription drug coverage and essential services for the 
elderly and disabled, in their homes or in care facilities, will be cut further."  

-Rev. John (Jack) Ewing, Retired Minister - Retired Assistant Professor of Gerontology 
-Joella Ewing - Gerontology Specialist (Issues of Aging)  

"YES" FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND DISABLED  
"Voting 'Yes' will offer renewed hope and greater self-reliance for people with severe mental illnesses by 
restoring Oregon Health Plan benefits for medications and mental health services, thereby reducing the 
need for emergency room services and in-patient care."

Parents and Educators Support Measure 30  

Community & Parents for Public Schools (CPPS) and the Portland Schools Alliance ask you to vote YES on 
Measure 30.  

We are grassroots organizations working to improve education for Oregon's children. Last May we all 
worked to protect our schools in Portland and Multnomah County. Why? Because we believe that our 
children deserve a decent education and that our economic recovery depends on a stable education 
system.  

This February, we are supporting the bi-partisan balanced budget plan, Measure 30. Why are we 
supportive? Because we believe all children in Oregon deserve a full school year, decent class sizes, and 
quality teachers.  

And without Measure 30, classrooms around the state--from kindergarten through high school--will lose 
more than $400 million in funding. For many school districts, that means cutting days and even weeks off of 
the school year. For example, Coos Bay would have to cut 15 days this school year alone.  

Faced with such a loss of revenue, many more school districts will be forced to make choices: shorten the 
school year, lose essential programs, lay off more teachers, or increase class sizes yet again. And that's on 
top of the 1000 Oregon teachers who have already lost their jobs.  

Remember, job growth in Oregon depends on a stable education system. Measure 30 means certainty for 
schools. Good schools mean a skilled workforce. And a skilled workforce is what businesses look for when 
deciding whether or not to come here, stay here and create jobs here.  

By passing Measure 30, we promote economic stability AND protect our vital services--we show that we 
care about our kids, our seniors, and our vulnerable neighbors who need a helping hand.  

Now is the time for us to do the right thing. 
Please, join us in voting YES on Measure 30.

HOPE (Help Out Public Education) urges a YES Vote on Measure 30!  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Help Out Public Education (HOPE), a grassroots group created by parents to help solve the funding crisis for 
schools in Multnomah County, urges your 'Yes' vote on Measure 30.  

We believe that strong public schools are the cornerstone of strong communities and a strong economy. 
Strong schools attract new businesses to our region. Strong schools ensure that our property values stay 
high. Strong schools create a work force that can respond to the increasing demands that our kids will face 
as they grow up and inherit the responsibilities of leading Oregon. Strong schools reflect what kind of state 
we are -- a state full of people who care about our kids and value public education.  

All across Oregon, schools stand to lose more than any other public service if Measure 30 fails. As a 
matter of fact, our schools will lose more than $400 million dollars if we don't support Measure 30.  

If Measure 30 fails, our children will feel the consequences. School years will be shortened. Teachers will be 
laid off. Programs will be eliminated. Achievement will suffer. Families will leave. The economy will endure 
greater setbacks than it already has. And we will be left to answer to our kids about why we let this happen.  

A "Yes" vote on Measure 30 is a realistic and responsible way to invest in our economic recovery by 
investing in our schools and our children. Measure 30 also goes a long way toward restoring economic 
stability and fairness; those who earn less pay less.  

Measure 30 is an investment in our economy and our schools that we can't afford NOT to make. Please vote 
YES on Measure 30.

Argument in Favor  

"Chris" is the best reason to vote YES on Measure 30.  

Chris is in his 40's and has had profound disabilities all his life. He cannot walk or, without assistance from 
caregivers, perform daily tasks we take for granted such as dressing, bathing and eating.  

In spite of these challenges, Chris lives in the community and works each day, operating specially adapted 
equipment to shred sensitive documents. Because of his job through a nonprofit community program, his 
wages help pay for part of his twenty-four hour care.  

Chris enjoys his work and is proud of his paycheck. He enjoys many other activities, such as church, shopping 
and movies, all activities that require the support of caregivers.  

The salaries of Chris' hardworking caregivers come from the state budget. Their wages are low, but the work 
they do to support Chris and others like him is essential.  

Helping to care for Chris is some of the most important work our state does. He used to live at Fairview, 
where his care cost far more than it does now, but his community care will always be necessary.  

Measure 30 will cost the average Oregonian less than 75 cents a week, but it will help continue the care that 
Chris and others like him with disabilities desperately need.

Oregon is at a crossroads. We can bring stability and certainty to our communities with a "Yes" vote, or we 
can mortgage our very future with a "No" vote by rejecting Oregon's bi-partisan balanced budget plan.  

•  Will my child have 58 students in her algebra class?  
•  Will my neighbor, a probation officer, have a job?  
•  Will our smaller communities unravel because we lack services to keep our seniors in their homes?

Oregon should pass Measure 30 because:  

 
 

 

 

 

 
> Oregon businesses, local communities and schools need the assurance that a balanced budget brings in 
order to provide jobs and jump-start Oregon's economy.  

> Oregonians' prosperity and future success depends on a secure budget plan to ensure our state's future 
and make sure Oregon stays, "Our Oregon" - the place we are proud to call home!  

> Oregonians simply cannot mortgage our children's future and our families' future on the flawed "borrow 
and spend" policies of those opposed to Measure 30.

Vote YES: 

Those who "make less, pay less." Measure 30 is balanced; those who are lower income pay 
a lower amount. For an average family it means about $24-$36 a year more in taxes.

minimum tax raised to a responsible amount and unnecessary corporate tax loopholes will

Vote YES to Help Oregon's Community Colleges 

Make Students' Dreams of Higher Education a Reality  

It's no secret that Oregon has been through a grueling two years of recession. Our community colleges are 
working hard to help Oregon families through job losses by retraining workers and by offering hope for a 
better life to thousands of students across the state.  

Oregon's 17 community colleges are doing all this with drastically reduced budgets.  

If voters reject the Legislature's bipartisan, balanced-budget plan, another $7-10 million will be cut from 
Oregon's community colleges. This comes on the heels of a 6 percent cut made last year. In order to cope, 
community colleges will have to raise tuition again. Tuition is already 30% higher than it was only five years 
ago. A community college degree costs about $21,000 - if it goes higher, many students will see their hopes 
of obtaining a college education dashed.  

Measure 30 is worth the investment in Oregon's future. It will provide necessary, temporary funding to 
keep vital services afloat until the economy recovers. Without it, students will face fewer courses, higher 
costs, increasing competition for financial aid, and more delays on the path to graduation and jobs - if they 
can still afford to attend school at all.

As seniors, advocates and long-term care providers 

we support the bipartisan, balanced budget plan 

enacted by the legislature. 

Seniors, their families and caregivers have struggled as services have been reduced over the last two years.  

Older Oregonians have worked hard all of their lives and greatly contributed to making our state and 
communities the places we all call home. They deserve to have Oregon keep its promises to them.  

In the next thirty years, Oregon will undergo an unprecedented "aging" of our population. The number of 
Oregonians 65 years of age and older is expected to more than double by 2030--making up 20% of the 
population.  

NOW IS THE TIME to be building and sustaining our system of care 

for older Oregonians -- there is simply no other choice.

their care givers through the provision of community-based services  

•  A Yes Vote: Helps keep 85,000 people -- including many seniors -- on the Oregon Health Plan, 

which provides healthcare funding for those who cannot afford it. If they go without, health 
insurance premiums will increase for all of us.

Help Oregonians Quit Smoking & Prevent Kids from Starting 

Vote YES on Measure 30  

Stabilize the Quit Line  

• 

In 1997, Oregonians voted to raise cigarette taxes to fund the Tobacco Quit Line as part of the 
Tobacco Prevention and Education Program.  

•  The Quit Line helps thousands of Oregonians quit tobacco each year. Quitting smoking lowers the 

• 

risk, and cost, of heart attacks, cancer, premature birth, asthma, and countless other diseases.  
Last spring, budget cuts unplugged the Quit Line. The bi-partisan balanced budget restored this 
cost-effective tool.  

•  Measure 30 will ensure that Oregonians who want to quit smoking can get help.  

Contain Costs for Businesses and Taxpayers  

•  Tobacco use costs Oregonians $1.5 billion per year in healthcare costs and lost productivity.  
•  Every $1 Oregon spends on tobacco prevention saves taxpayers $33.  
•  Measure 30 will ensure stability for tobacco prevention, reducing tobacco-related disease and 
their healthcare costs. This will save money for taxpayers and businesses, who foot the bill for 
preventable tobacco-related illness.  

Maintain Oregon's Cigarette Tax & Prevent Youth from Smoking  

•  Measure 30 renews a 10-cent cigarette surtax that has been in effect since 1993. If the measure 
fails, the tax will end and Oregon would be the first state in a decade to lower its cigarette tax.  

•  A high cigarette price has been shown to be one of the best ways to keep youth from smoking. 

Lowering Oregon's cigarette tax will make it cheaper for youth to get cigarettes.

NOTHING IN OREGON HAS GREATER IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY THAN PUBLIC EDUCATION.  

Public education is Oregon's economic engine

In this era of high unemployment, we must attract business and create jobs. Supporting Oregon's 
education system is a good strategy for economic development.  

•  Businesses large and small choose to move to states with a strong and stable education system - 

business owners and mangers have their own children to educate.  
Skilled workers are fundamental to any business' decision to locate in a state.

A "NO" vote on ballot measure #30 will force our Legislators and Governor to cut waste and unnecessary 
programs. They do not want to do that. We, the people, must provide the resolve.  

A "NO" vote says that the $800,000,000 this tax increase would raise is better spent by the people 
themselves. The private sector marketplace has internal decision making mechanisms that build the 

 
 

 

 

 

 
strongest economy. Inefficient bureaucracies on the other hand, tend toward low quality services and high 
costs.  

A "NO" vote is a vote for liberty. Bigger government crowds into our personal lives diminishing our freedom. 
A "NO" vote informs state government regarding its proper limits.  

During the 1990's Oregon government grew at double digit annual rates. Now, however, is the time for 
some housecleaning. Vote "NO" if you want that house cleaning to be done.

Argument in Opposition  

LIBERTARIANS SAY 

VOTE "NO" ON MEASURE 30  

Higher Taxes and Caring are Not the Same  

Some say that if you don't support higher taxes, you don't care about people. They're wrong. Sometimes, 
opposing taxes is compassionate. By voting "NO" Measure 30, you can:  

•  Help Struggling Families  

Most of Oregon remains in a severe economic recession and thousands of families are just scraping 
by. Even $150-200 in new taxes represents a dozen bags of groceries, ten tanks of gas or a medical 
bill. Measure 30 would only add stress to their lives.  

•  Protect and Create Jobs  

Taxes are already driving jobs out of Oregon. Measure 30 would drive jobs out even faster while 
crippling new investment and job creation. Unemployed workers need hope and opportunity, but 
raising taxes during a recession destroys both.  

•  Preserve Public Services  

Did you know that 11 of 13 state agencies have no internal auditing function to protect $12 billion 
of our money? Despite what you hear, waste is everywhere. Unless we stop the bleeding, critical 
programs like K-12 education will struggle no matter how much money we give them. Measure 30 
would let legislators off the hook, promising a bigger mess for us to fix later.  

In November the Libertarian Party offered a better plan - one that would fix Oregon's budget problems 
while raising billions by selling SAIF, a state-owned piece of corporate welfare. Other organizations have 
offered plans as well. Instead of hurting people with taxes, we can help them with plans like ours.  

Republican and Democratic legislators supporting Measure 30 are out of touch with the average person. 
They're preserving their power at your expense by pandering to powerful special interests. They want to 
pull at your heart strings, but don't let them. If you want to cast a compassionate ballot, vote "NO" on 
Measure 30.

Jobs, Not More Taxes. No on Measure 30!  

Measure 30 repeals Oregon's largest tax increase passed by the legislature last August. $1.1 billion in new 
taxes: seven new taxes on Oregon individuals, families, businesses, and seniors. Oregonians now have the 
power to say no.  

Oregon Needs to Economic Development to Create New Tax Revenues  

While ranking highest in the nation in unemployment, Oregon's legislators and Governor chose added 
burden by passing these outrageous taxes. Many large employers have left the state due to our harsh 
business climate. The way to solve Oregon's economic problems is removing costly barriers to job 
expansion, helping businesses succeed.  

Kulongoski Grants Pay Raises to Some While Pushing for New Taxes  

The governor authorized new pay raises for some employees while stumping for this record tax package. 
The governor, at his inauguration, promised no new taxes and vowed to "find other ways." A few months 
later, he now leads the charge for the record $1.1 billion in new taxes on families, businesses and seniors.  

Legislature Passed Record Tax Increases While Passing Bonding for a Major League Stadium in Portland  

While passing the largest tax increase in the history of Oregon, they passed a bill to create funds for a new 
Major League baseball stadium in Portland. This shows just how out of touch many legislators and the 
governor are!  

Not a Single Public Hearing Held  

Not only did legislators and the governor pass these taxes, they did it without a single public hearing. Now is 
our time for a public hearing by ballot!  

Oregonians Submit Record Signatures to Repeal Legislature's Tax  

147,000 signatures were collected in just 90 days. Some are reporting that the package has little support 
from the public; this is simply not true. Oregonians throughout the state know that now is not the time for 
more taxes.

Argument in Opposition  

 

 

It's Not Fair to Senior Citizens!  

We urge you to vote no on Measure 30 and protect Oregon's seniors!  

Fifty years ago, I volunteered for active military service to protect freedom in this Country. Now, I am living 
on a minimal, fixed, retirement income. Like most senior citizens, I will not have the additional funds to pay if 
Measure 30 passes.  

Unlike government, I can't "wave a magic wand" and increase my retirement income. Nor, can I buy things 
that are "nice" to have, but more than my budget allows. If the Measure passes, I will have to make hard 
decisions about which necessary expenses to cut in order to pay additional taxes.  

Oregon's seniors have given a great deal to the state throughout years of service and dedication. Instead of 
looking out for seniors, when government lacked the courage to make tough decisions and balance the 
budget, they leapt at the notion of raising taxes. And it is senior citizens that will be hit most drastically!  

Politicians talk about wanting to protect seniors and wanting to help care for them. This is the exact 
opposite of what this plan would do. The proposed taxes target seniors in many ways, forcing them into 
paying tens of millions of dollars they simply cannot afford:  

Increased income taxes  

• 
•  The reduction (or, worse, elimination) of medical deduction capabilities  
•  A reduction in the discount seniors would receive for paying property taxes early  

These taxes are not aimed at caring for Oregon's vulnerable; they are aimed at ways to bleed Oregonians--
especially seniors--of more and more of their limited resources to fund a government that cannot control 
spending! Over-taxing senior citizens living on fixed incomes is not an idea we should employ, nor a trap we 
should fall into.  

Again, please vote no on measure 30 and protect Oregon's senior citizens!

Oregon Needs Jobs, Not new Taxes  

Vote No on Measure 30, the $1.2 billion tax increase.  

Oregon's economy is in trouble, and a tax hike will make things worse. Study after study has shown that tax 
hikes slow economic growth, leading to fewer jobs. Workers across the state are already losing jobs because 
tax hikes and bad policies encourage businesses to move. Oregon has the highest unemployment rate in the 
country, and cannot afford to lose more jobs.  

The state's budget crisis is a spending problem, not a revenue problem. The politicians in Salem would have 
you believe that they need more money in order provide important state services. What they do not 

 
 

 

 

 

 
mention is that between 1989 and 2003 Oregon's general fund budget increased an astonishing 151 
percent. Under the leadership of former Gov. Kitzhaber, spending in Oregon grew faster than in any other 
state. The tax hike currently being proposed would cement these wasteful indulgences permanently into 
Oregon's budget, meaning more expensive government for generations to come. Now is the time end the 
spending spree of the 1990s by voting NO ON 30.  

When divided among the roughly 1.3 million households in Oregon, the $1.2 billion tax hike costs about 
$825 more in taxes per household.  

Measure 30 increase taxes on almost everyone, and is particularly hard on Oregon's seniors. It increases 
property taxes and eliminates medical deductions, harshly penalizing seniors and those on fixed incomes. 
Measure 30 raises income taxes, cutting into the paychecks of everyone who still has a job--and there will be 
fewer of those if the tax hike succeeds. Measure 30 raises a slew of business taxes, which will scare away 
more jobs, enforcing Oregon's title as the home of the highest unemployment in the nation.  

Our politicians must take responsibility for wasteful spending, not asking for even more money from hard-
working men and women in our state.  

VOTE NO ON MEASURE 30 and save Oregon's economy.  

(This information furnished by Russ Walker, Oregon Director, Oregon Citizens For A Sound Economy PAC.)  

Argument in Opposition  

Vote NO on Measure 30! We must work together to put an end to the disgraceful treatment of Oregon's 
seniors and the unfair tax burden they are being asked to bear.  

During this time of strong economic pressures, the Oregon legislature has seen fit to increase a variety of 
taxes...again.  

But not only are they trying to raise taxes on all Oregonians, they have unfairly targeted seniors by 
eliminating or reducing the amount of medical expenses a senior citizen may deduct from his or her taxes.  

With never-ending increases in our property taxes, income taxes and now this reduction (elimination for 
some) of medical deductions for seniors, it is time to say no! to these heavy burdens.  

Seniors have contributed greatly to Oregon and should not shoulder this additional burden! Soon, there will 
be little or no incentive for Oregon's seniors to stay and live in this great state we have helped to grow.  

Medical costs are skyrocketing and Oregon's senior citizens deserve the opportunity to help defray those 
costs through medical deductions. Both raising the age limit and slashing the percentages that can be 
deducted are terrible schemes designed at hitting seniors for every tax dollar possible.  

And seniors or not, targeting a specific group of Oregonians to bear the weight of a broad-based economic 
problem is outrageous. Balancing the Oregon state budget on the backs of senior citizens is totally unfair 
and undemocratic.  

At a time in their lives when we should protect our seniors and return to them a fraction of the commitment 
they have given to Oregon over the years, the legislature wants to tax them from all directions. This is simply 
wrong! There is not another way to put it.

Argument in Opposition  

 

 

No new taxes! That was the voters' clear message when we defeated Measure 28 last January. 
Astoundingly, the legislature has ignored us and created an even bigger tax increase! So we must say NO 
again.  

As before, tax proponents make dire predictions about impending collapse of government services. But this 
$800 million tax amounts to only 2% of the state's $37 billion budget. That amount is too small to 
compromise essential services. It hardly justifies the hysterical rhetoric some tax proponents use.  

The state's all funds biennial budgets for the past decade show a pattern of excessive growth. The totals:  

1993/95  $18.9 billion; 

1995/97  $22.5 billion; 

1997/99  $26.7 billion; 

1999/01  $29.3 billion; 

2001/03  $34.6 billion; 

2003/05  $37.1 billion. 

With the tax increase, the current budget grows by $2.5 billion. Even without the proposed tax, the budget 
will still grow by $1.7 billion. Defeat of this tax increase won't cut the budget; it only slows down an 
excessively large growth rate.  

During the 1990's economic boom, the state's budget nearly doubled. If spending growth since 1993 had 
been limited to offset inflation and population growth, the 2003/05 budget would be $8 billion less than 
$37.1 billion. The legislature spent every dime of that new revenue. Now when times are slow, our 
legislature has no savings, no fiscal discipline, wants new taxes, and won't listen to the people. Our tax 
system doesn't need fixing. The legislature's spending practices need major reform.  

This tax referendum has symbolic value far greater than just the $800 million tax. The legislature is planning 
a special session in June to restructure Oregon's taxes. You can be sure that restructure really means large 
INCREASES in taxes, including a sales tax. Unless we defeat Measure 30 decisively, our legislators will 
conclude that Oregonians want more taxes. And that is what we will get.  

Repeat the message of Measure 28: NO NEW TAXES! Vote NO on Measure 30.

Argument in Opposition  

For the past three years, the biggest issue facing the state of Oregon has been job creation. Oregon's 
economy has struggled more than every other state's, and as a result, Oregon has become the most 
unemployed state in the nation.  

One of the consequences of the poor economy has been reduced tax collections for state government. And 
while everyday Oregonians and small businesses have struggled and fought their way through a slumping 
economy, state government has decided it needs a $1 billion bailout courtesy of the Oregon taxpayer.  

In the waning days of the 2003 legislative session, the Oregon legislature passed a 3-year, $1 billion tax 
increase. Increased income taxes. Increased property taxes. Increased taxes on small business. The 
legislature left no tax untouched. So much for job creation.  

NFIB/Oregon represents over 12,000 Oregon small businesses. The members of NFIB/Oregon voted 
overwhelmingly to oppose this tax increase for two reasons. First, the small business owners of Oregon 
would like to see state government do the hard work of living within its means, just like every other Oregon 
business or family has had to do. Second, NFIB members believe that a tax increase of this magnitude will 
exact a heavy toll on the ability of Oregon businesses to grow and create jobs.  

If left alone, Oregon's economy will recover and state government will once again have the tax revenues it 
wants. Already, the last official state revenue forecast (December 2003) showed that tax collections were 
once again starting to increase (approximately $70 million). If Oregon's economy can start producing these 
results on its own, then there is certainly no need to impose a job-killing tax increase.  

NFIB believes the best strategy for producing more tax revenue is to leave the private sector alone to create 
more jobs. To saddle our struggling economy with a $1 billion tax increase is exactly the wrong approach.  

Please vote NO on Ballot Measure 30.

Argument in Opposition  

Our politicians in Salem perpetually claim they never have enough money. They regularly tell us that they'll 
have to cut government to-the-bone because taxpayers are too uncompassionate.  

Forgive the liberal use of the exclamation points which follow, but the facts do tell a different story.  

* The US Census Bureau, currently states that Oregon state & local governments spend more per-capita 
than 44 other states!!!  

* June, 2003, USA Today reported that State of Oregon spending has been increasing at a rate faster than 
the growth of population and inflation, combined!!!  

* November, 2003, The Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, shows the state budget has averaged double-
digit growth (+13%) over the last 25 years!!!

Argument in Opposition  

Funny what the politicians do with the millions we send them!  

$500 million: The cost for new, unnecessary, programs created by the 2001 Legislature according to 
Oregon Tax Research.  

$29 million: Amount estimated that the Department of Health & Human Services has unspent from the 
previous budget.  

$39 million: The amount the state could have saved if it had made better use of Temporary employees (as 
advised by state auditors back in 1996).  

$25 million: An estimated amount if the politicians eliminated some of the 2000 vacant positions still 
existing in state government.  

$24 million: The maximum amount identified by auditors on how much money was misspent by Multnomah 
County in the construction of four buildings.  

$20 million: The amount the state would gain if it would sell off the fleet and privatize the state motor pool.  

$10 million: The estimated welfare overpayments every budget cycle according to the Federal Government. 
The problem has been unresolved since 1996.  

$8 million: The amount governor (while claiming the state was out of money) handed out in discretionary 
bonuses to public employees.  

$1.2 million: The amount dedicated for light rail art projects.  

There are many ideas to help government balance their budgets without new taxes. The politicians could sell 
unused government properties, increase competition among government services, and open up more timber 
land for harvesting. One idea, that would save millions, would be to create a state employee health 
insurance pool to stop skyrocketing health insurance costs. Oregon also needs a spending limit, like 
Colorado, so government does not grow faster than the citizen's ability to pay.

"Finally, if history is any guide, states that try to respond to slow revenue 

growth and budget deficits with tax hikes will not gain tax revenues, they will lose 

businesses, jobs, and families. In the last U.S. recession, the states that 

actually cut taxes to promote economic growth and job creation saw the most 

rapid return to fiscal and economic health. States cannot tax their way to 

prosperity; or balanced budgets for that matter. We believe this is the most 

critical recession survival lesson of all."

Argument in Opposition  

Before each of our five kids left home for college, I had a heart-to-heart talk with them. I asked them to 
repeat after me "I...can't afford it." Why? Because one of the things they must learn is spending discipline - 
how to say "no thank you" because they can't afford it.  

I am opposed to Measure 30, the $800 million tax increase our state legislators are trying to pass onto hard 
working Oregon families. Measure 30 will have a negative effect on Oregon; slowing the state's economic 
recovery, costing us jobs, and raising taxes on seniors, business owners and property owners.  

We need to prioritize our needs and spend accordingly to deliver the results that are best for Oregon. Too 
often this is something our elected officials don't understand. Take for example:  

•  The Oregon Department of Administrative Services which ordered seven luxury SUV's with 

premium CD players.1  

•  The Oregon Department of Adult and Family Services which ordered a dozen high-end computers 

when comparable machines costing half as much were available.2  

•  We Oregon taxpayers paid $212,000 for several members of the Public Utility Commission to 
travel around Armenia, Brazil, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal Romania and Zambia teaching others 
about Oregon's model utility systems.3  

All of this and much more while funding for essential services goes wanting. It's just not right. The State 
Legislature has a responsibility to say "no thank you" to wasteful governmental spending, but in the 
meantime, Oregon voters should say "no thank you" to Measure 30.

Argument in Opposition  

Where will it stop?! With high unemployment and low economic development, a new state tax will have 
nothing but a negative impact on our economy.  

Voters in Multnomah County recently passed a local tax with the promise that it would protect schools and 
vital services. Multnomah County voters agreed to pay more and with Measure 30, we will be double taxed 
with new county AND state taxes.  

Oregonians are again being asked for more taxes in the form of income, property, business, and cigarette 
taxes. In addition, there are higher taxes for specific groups: seniors, small businesses, corporations and 
even SUV owners.  

One of the Multnomah County Commissioners dared to say that they might refund up to thirty percent of 
the county tax if the state tax is imposed. THIRTY PERCENT? MAYBE? Where will it end?  

It seems that every time voters agree to pay higher taxes based on needs expressed to them by elected 
officials, the goal is moved further away. Taxpayers are continually strung along and asked for more money. 
It is as if we are an endless well politicians believe they can tap again and again.  

We must put a stop to this! By allowing taxes to go up again in less than a year, we are only fostering the 
uncontrollable spending in state government. The situation is even worse in Multnomah County where 
double taxation will mean a windfall for county bureaucrats and drastically hurt thousands of families.  

Send the message to our county and state officials that this can't continue.  

Vote no on Measure 30.

Argument in Opposition  

OREGONIANS DESERVE MORE!  

The root of Oregon's budget problem is not a lack of taxes; it is a lack of fiscal responsibility. The honest 
answer to our current shortfall is for government to act responsibly and do only what is necessary.  

Fiscal discipline is the solution. The idea of multiple taxes was not hard to come up with - business as usual. It 
does not take innovation or restraint to continue throwing money around. The hard choice would have been 
to control spending and undertake a process of prioritizing and evaluating core government functions.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
This state must aggressively encourage business and job creation, ultimately producing increased revenue. 
Businesses provide jobs and pay taxes; people with jobs pay taxes. By continuing to raise taxes on 
businesses, the state is driving away the very revenue it seeks. Businesses are leaving and we continue to 
lose jobs.  

Economists from the Congressional Budget Office to numerous policy think tanks agree on a fundamental 
premise: raising taxes results in less revenue; lowering taxes results in increased revenue.  

Washington Governor Gary Locke (D) resolved a $2 billion budget shortfall in 2003. Locke realized that tax 
increases were unacceptable and moved his state to a common sense "Priorities in Government" model: 
Budgeting should focus on achieving clearly defined results, not blindly adjusting spending levels. This 
bipartisan process enabled Washington to balance a budget without general tax increases. Oregon has 
these tools, but lacks the political will. The Oregon Audit Division Director confirms that our "budgets are 
not linked to the measures."  

No measure of accountability or success, no insurance of efficiency. How can taxpayers know if the budget 
problems stem from a legitimate lack of revenue or from out-of-control spending?  

Now is the time for a discussion about fair and equitable taxation to fund programs and services leaving no 
Oregonian behind, NOT the time to support the largest tax increase in Oregon history. Please vote NO!

Argument in Opposition  

MEASURE 30 WILL BREAK THE BACKBONE OF OREGON'S ECONOMY.  

Jobs. Community service. State and local tax revenues. These are all benefits provided to Oregon through 
the most important component of our economy - small businesses. The tax increases proposed in Measure 
30 will break our small businesses, forcing them to cut jobs and close doors. This is NOT something Oregon 
can afford.  

For 21 years, we have poured ourselves into the management of our small business. Working in the housing 
and the hospitality industries, we are able to share our great state with visitors and friends. While proud to 
share Oregon, we are deeply concerned with the direction policies like these tax increases are taking our 
state and its economy.  

It has always been a privilege and joy to own a business of our own, but the pleasure is quickly becoming 
overshadowed by the obscene taxation Oregon's government continues to throw at us. Small businesses 
will be drastically affected by these taxes. In order to pay the increases, businesses will have to make cuts in 
the operating costs. Jobs. They will have to cut jobs and employment in order to make up for the outrageous 
hikes in taxes.  

This is going to be the truth for small businesses throughout all of Oregon. Hotels, restaurants, builders, 
retailers, and many others will be forced to scale back employment costs. At a time when we already have 
outrageous unemployment and our larger companies are leaving at a rapid pace, we cannot afford to 
jeopardize the lives of our small businesses through unreasonable tax burdens.  

Oregon needs jobs and economic development, not higher taxes and further constraints on the backbone of 
our economy. Help us protect small businesses. Help us protect jobs. Vote NO on Measure 30!

The Oregon Family Council urges Oregonians to vote NO on Measure 30  

Taxes ARE a Family Value!  

For nearly 25 years the Oregon Family Council has promoted policies to strengthen families. It is rare for us 
to take such a strong position on a tax issue. However, the impact of Measure 30's billion dollar tax increase 
on families is so devastating, we cannot keep silent.  

Four Ways Measure 30 Hurts Families  

1. Measure 30 increases family income and property taxes. Measure 30 raises income taxes by as much as 
9%. It also removes the discount for timely payments of property taxes.  

2. Measure 30 removes medical deductions for the elderly. For many seniors this will increase their annual 
taxes several hundred dollars.  

3. Measure 30 could leave many families jobless. Oregon already leads the nation in unemployment. This 
billion dollar tax increase will hurt our struggling economy resulting in more layoffs.  

4. Measure 30 will increase the cost of raising a family. Measure 30 increases five business taxes. These 
increases will be passed on to families in the form of higher prices.  

Higher Taxes are not the Answer  

Many families already struggle to make ends meet. Medical costs increase more than 15% each year, 
gasoline is nearing all-time highs and Oregon leads the nation in unemployment even before this tax 
increase!  

School funding is touted as the primary reason for Measure 30. However, our research shows that it is 
involved parents, not increased school spending that contributes most to children's academic success. 
Because the increases of Measure 30 will require more time on the job to make ends meet, it won't solve our 
education problems, it will make them worse.  

Please cast a vote for families, Vote NO on Measure 30!

The Road to Oregon's Future 

 
 

 

 

 

 
Three months ago, Oregon's politicians made a poor choice. They passed a $1.1 billion tax increase on 
working families, homeowners, small businesses, and seniors. Now, because of Oregon's unique election 
laws, we voters have been given the chance to make a choice of our own. In February, we will decide to 
accept or reject this tax increase.  

150,000 Oregon taxpayers signed a petition to refer the tax increase to you and I, the voters. As someone 
who invested much time and effort into the drive to gain signatures, it's no surprise where I stand. I will vote, 
and work hard, to stop this jobs-killing tax increase.  

Here's why it's so important to me.  

We've seen the destination that lies down the path of higher taxes. Oregonians suffer from the highest 
unemployment in the nation, a sluggish economy, and record-high rates of bankruptcy and small business 
closings. This not only hurts working families and small businesses, but is also robs vital programs like 
education and healthcare of precious resources.  

Rejection of this tax increase means more money in our paychecks, more money for our kids' college 
education, our mortgages, car payments and credit card bills, and our retirements.  

There exists a tested, proven and far more just way to provide government the revenue it needs without 
penalizing working men and women. It's the big government, high tax programs that have made Oregon an 
economic basket case. It's economic growth, more jobs, higher salaries, and the resultant higher revenues 
that will fix the problem. Ultimately, we can fund invaluable programs like healthcare and education if we 
bolster our economy.  

That's the path over 150,000 Oregonians chose when they signed petitions to refer the taxes. Now let's 
vote together to reject it.

Argument in Opposition  

MEASURE 30 IS FAR MORE THAN INCOME TAXES  

As Oregonians, we understand the need for services government is set up to provide: education, health care 
for the needy, roads, and public safety to name a few. As taxpayers, we understand the need to contribute 
for these services through fair and equitable taxation.  

As senior citizens, we have spent years contributing through income and property taxes, as well as fees and 
charges hidden in everyday activity. Now, the Oregon Legislature wants us to pay more than our fair share.  

We have been paying property taxes to local government for years; and, while we understand the necessity 
behind taxes, we cannot stomach it when we are taxed unfairly and excessively. This is exactly what Ballot 
Measure 30 would do.  

Measure 30 goes far beyond the commonly discussed income tax surcharge. It will impose a 1.5 percent 
increase on property taxes by slashing the early payment discount in half.  

 
 

 

 

 

 
Worse - state government is taking these property taxes for its own use, not leaving it to local governments 
as usual. Legislators and a governor that could not make the tough choices are turning to property owners to 
cover the state's budget shortfall.  

The Governor said he would not raise taxes, yet supports a measure that will unfairly raise property taxes, 
hitting seniors and Oregonians who have spent years working toward home ownership. We ought to be 
encouraging the purchasing of homes, not forcing property owners into paying for a state government that 
cannot control spending.  

We need to send a message once and for all to our elected representatives that enough is enough. Live 
within your budgets and stop asking Oregonians for more than they can give.  

Please join us in voting No on Measure 30 this February!

Argument in Opposition  

Good citizens should want to follow the lead of their rulers. But when rulers burden the people, it is their 
right and responsibility to seek relief. In the Bible, God's people asked their new ruler in 1 Kings 12 to lower 
their taxes, saying "lighten the hard service ... and heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you."  

We are in the midst of difficult economic circumstances. Oregonians are straining to keep up with the 
burden of rising costs of health care, gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other essentials. But their 
paychecks aren't growing, and in many cases, are getting smaller.  

Now the Legislature is trying to raise our taxes, making our paychecks even smaller. Enough is enough. It's 
our right, and we think, our responsibility, to say "No" to the increased burden of higher taxes.  

This new tax hike would:  

•  Raise income taxes by as much as 9%! Did you get a 9% raise this year?  
• 

Increase taxes on the elderly by cutting their medical deductions! Do you want the tax bills of our 
sick seniors to increase?  

•  Raise taxes on businesses! Do you want Oregon's economy to take yet another hit?  
•  Cut your discount for timely payment of property taxes! Do you think your property taxes should 

go up?  

Don't let the government bureaucracy make you feel guilty about saying "No" to more taxes. Have you ever 
known them to be content with the money they are taking? Wisdom tells us some people just can't get 
enough, ever. It's our job to tell them "No."

They want to raise your taxes while they exempt 

million dollar condo  

 

 

•  One condo in the 600 Block on Portland's NW 11th: Asking price: $1,975,000, annual property tax: 

• 

$146.74 www.rmlsweb.com, 10/21/03  
"...state and city virtually eliminate the property tax on spanking new $425,000 condos...", Steve

•  1300 block NW Irving St. - $18,496,020 untaxed value www.saveportland.com  
•  $2,000 a month luxury apartment "...in a building whose owners don't pay property tax on the 

structure for 10 years." Scott Learn, The Oregonian 6/27/03  

Such a deal for Portland's rich!  

These are just a few examples of the tax breaks authorized by the Oregon State legislature that end up 
benefiting well connected developers and some of our richest residents. Now they want us to pay more tax! 
Just say NO!  

But there's more!  

In Multnomah County alone, another $53 million, paid by taxpayers, was diverted to urban renewal districts. 
This money is kept in their own district to pay for fancy new roads, sidewalks, parks and sewers while the 
rest of us have to make up the difference and pay for their basic services like police and fire protection. They 
live high on the hog while we pay! Just say NO!  

Portland's urban renewal districts include:  

•  Portland's yuppie theme park (the Pearl District)  
•  Portland's Downtown Waterfront  
•  Portland's South Park Blocks  
•  Portland's Convention Center  
•  Portland's South Waterfront - the City's new billion dollar scheme to subsidize construction of 

thousands of units of high-rise apartments and offices on the riverbank  

Now they went all of us to make up the difference. Just say NO!  

Shouldn't Portland's elite freeloaders pay their fair share before they ask the rest of us to pay more?  

Just Say NO!
