 JUDICIAL CANDIDATES AUTOMATICALLY NOMINATED FROM 2004 PRIMARY 

ELECTION TO 2004 GENERAL ELECTION  

In certain cases, some nonpartisan judicial offices that were open for filing for the May 18, 2004, 
Primary Election appear on our website’s official candidate list for the Primary election as “no 
candidate filed.” For the following candidates, this does not mean they did not file or qualify for 
the 2004 Primary Election. Because of state law affecting nonpartisan candidates who file for an 
office that is up for election to fill a mid-term vacancy, these candidates are automatically 
nominated to the 2004 General Election without appearing on the 2004 Primary Election ballot. 
The reason for this situation is explained in more detail after the following list of candidate 
names.  
For your information, we provide the following list of the state candidates who are 
automatically nominated to the 2004 General Election ballot and will not appear on the 2004 
Primary Election ballot. ORS 249.091. They are:  

• Darleen Ortega, Judge of the Court of Appeals, Position 3, Incumbent  
• Alicia A. Fuchs, Judge of the Circuit Court, 4th District, Position 15, Incumbent  
• Eric J. Bloch, Judge of the Circuit Court, 4th District, Position 20, Incumbent  
• Susie L. Huva, Judge of the Circuit Court, 5th District, Position 4  
• Douglas V. Van Dyk, Judge of the Circuit Court, 5th District, Position 4, Incumbent  
• Thomas J. Rastetter, Judge of the Circuit Court, 5th District, Position 10, Incumbent  
• Michael Newman, Judge of the Circuit Court, 14th District, Position 3, Incumbent  
• Lindi Baker, Judge of the Circuit Court, 14th District, Position 4, Incumbent  

 
Questions often arise regarding nominations to nonpartisan office. ORS 249.091 provides that if 
only one or two candidates have filed for the offices of Sheriff, County Treasurer or County 
Clerk, or to fill a vacancy in a nonpartisan office, then those candidates shall be the nominees for 
that office at the general election only. The names of those candidates shall not be printed on the 
ballot at the primary election. Please note that if the nonpartisan office would regularly be filled 
by election during this election year, the regular election rule in ORS 249.088 applies.  
However, if three or more candidates file for County Clerk, Treasurer, Sheriff or a nonpartisan 
office to fill a vacancy, the contest will be on the primary ballot at the nominating election. If one 
of the three or more candidates receives a majority of the votes cast (50% plus one vote), then 
only that candidate is nominated and goes forward to the general election ballot. (They are not 
elected at the primary election.) If no one receives a majority, then the top two vote getters move 
forward to the general election.  
Also, a nonpartisan candidate (except those described above) can be elected at the primary 
election if the candidates receive a majority of the votes cast (50% plus one vote). ORS 249.088. 
As noted above, ORS 249.091 applies only to the nonpartisan offices where the candidate must 
be elected at the general election as provided by Article V, section 16 and Article VI, section 6 of 
the Oregon Constitution.
